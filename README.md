This is my first major project, where I dive deep into the backend aspect of web development.
This web project is mainly based on the background of building RESTful APIs with Django Framework and Django REST framework.

I have learned to navigate through models, views, urls, create views, models, serializers, filters, and applying all of this logic to create an imaginary web shop.

This web shop contains Collections, and these collections each contain Products, which a Customer can add to their respective Cart. These Customers can create User accounts, place Orders and write Reviews.

Furthermore a functional authorization system has been implemented using the JWT (JSON Web Token) authentication plugin for Django REST Framework. This system authorizes users and allows or denies them access at different endpoints depending wether they are authorized or not.


Various endpoints of this web application:
